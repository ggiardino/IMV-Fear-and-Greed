# IMV-Fear-and-Greed


What is the Fear & Greed Index?

The Fear & Greed Index is a way to gauge stock market movements and whether stocks are fairly priced. The theory is based on the logic that excessive fear tends to drive down share prices, and too much greed tends to have the opposite effect.

How is Fear & Greed Calculated?

The Fear & Greed Index is a compilation of 3 different indicators that measure some aspect of stock market behavior. They are Index Deviation, Volume Deviation & CCL Deviation. The index tracks how much these individual indicators deviate from their averages compared to how much they normally diverge. The index gives each indicator a weighting and a score from 0 to 100, with 100 representing maximum greediness and 0 signaling maximum fear.
